This repository contains the code from our paper "Sample Complexity Bounds for Linear System Identification from a Finite Set" which can be acessed [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11141). 

## Installation
To install all relevant packages execute 
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Experiments
To run Experiment 1 (2, 3) navigate to the src folder and execute 
``` terminal
python main.py --exp=1
```
The experiment will then be run which might take some time. This will create a data folder (if necessary) and safe the results inside.
